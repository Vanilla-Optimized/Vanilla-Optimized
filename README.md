### - This modpack uses the _**nvidium**_ mod and uses an unusual technology (mesh shaders). If you have a graphics card from AMD or below GTX 16 series, please remove or disable the mod from the modpack. But according to the mod developer: "No, the mod is not functional on non-Nvidia systems, but the Nvidium will automatically disable itself. Your gameplay will not be affected."
