## 1.4.1 for 1.20.4 now `Archived Version`

### For several reasons:

1. `Not the popularity of the version`. At the moment modpack version for 1.20.4 is unpopular (You can see the downloaded versions on Modrinth) as new versions of minecraft come out and it is interesting to play in new versions (if about vanilla gameplay*).
2. `Updated Mods`. Yes updated mods are already rarely released on this version (fixes and etc for mods) as mod developers are more focused on updated new versions of mods for new versions of minecraft. (With the exception if debts updated mods or global updated mods).
3. `I'm wasting my time`.  At the moment I spend my time on the not popular version (First point) at the moment I want to update the current version of minecraft.

### In short I will not already update the modpack version to 1.20.4 if there are debts on mods or global updated mods.
