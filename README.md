### **Support OptiFine functionality**

Modpack Vortexial Optimized supports most of the functionality of OptiFine (Shaders,Resource  packs for OptiFine, etc.) that allows you to refuse OptiFine in favor of modpack.

### **Performance**

Thanks to modern performance mods in Vortexial Optimized such as Sodium, FerriteCore, ImmediatelyFast and others allowing you to fix the problems of Vanilla Minecraft and double the performance on low computers.

### **Vanilla Gameplay**

Vortexial Optimized does not change the gameplay of Minecraft that allows you to feel the gameplay if you were playing on Vanilla Minecraft.

### **Built on Fabric**

Vortexial Optimized uses the Fabric mod loader which allows it to be fast, lightweight, updates quickly and supports most mods on this loader. For the reason that the modpack is built on Fabric you can run it on Quilt Loader.

### Freedom of modding

Vortexial Optimized does not restrict users who downloaded the modpack to use other mods to improve gameplay and experience.On the contrary allows you to build your own constructor on the basis of modpack
